# Gradient-descent route manuscript (working draft)

This directory holds the manuscript on the dynamics inside learning-rate planes
of full-batch gradient descent: certified periodic windows inside chaotic
training, and an exploratory quasi-periodic route (Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of
the edge-of-stability 2-cycle, invariant circles, phase-locked windows). The
draft is private; framing, authorship, license and release are the human
author's decisions.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Manuscript source | `main.tex`, `references.bib` |
| Numbers quoted in the text | `generated-numbers.tex` (generated), manifest `data/numbers.json` |
| Figures and their receipts | `figures/f*.py` write `f*.pdf`, `f*.png` and `f*.provenance.json` |
| Index of all receipts | `provenance.json` |
| Review copy of the compiled draft | `gd-route-working-draft.pdf` |

Section 4 reports the prospectively designed, independently audited map study.
Section 5 is exploratory: its analyses were chosen while exploring and have not
been tested on fresh networks or seeds. Orange boxes in the PDF mark results
other work streams are still producing. Every citation must be checked at its
primary source before release; entries marked `[title to verify]` carry only
identifiers.

## Rebuild and verify

Figures read saved evidence from the data store (`NEURAL_SHRIMP_DATA`, default
`/data2/neural-shrimp-data`); figure 6 recomputes four short trajectories.

```sh
cd paper/gd-route/figures && for f in f[0-9]_*.py; do python "$f"; done
cd .. && python scripts/build_numbers.py
latexmk -pdf main.tex
python scripts/verify.py
```

`verify.py` re-derives every number, regenerates every figure byte for byte
against its receipt, checks that each macro used in the text is generated, and
that every repository path the text cites exists in the committed tree.
